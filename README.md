# Prompt Generator App

A small Flutter app with 2 screens:  
1. **Prompt Screen** — enter your idea.  
2. **Result Screen** — shows loading → mock image → retry or go back.  

This project is a test assignment. The goal is to demonstrate working with **flutter_bloc**, navigation, UI/UX, error handling, and simple animations.
